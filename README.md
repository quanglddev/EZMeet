  An iOS app using Google Maps Platform and Places APIs to find the best place for friends to meetup automatically. It uses K-Means algorithm to determine the shortest routes (in total) for everyone. It will also suggest new places for you to visit so you can come up with new creative ideas during the meeting (new settings stimulate creative).
